It will become obvious soon that I orginally meant for this project to be bigger then it needed to be and I am going to eventually add more to the project. 
However, I realized that authorazation is later in this boot camp and there is no need for me to try and do it on my own. 
There are a few ghost pages full of a whole lot of nothing.

there is one point where i did not meet full requirement of this project and am asking for help on figuring out how to pull up blogs and authors. 
I vreated a page for the authors to be selected and then route to a blog selection page. the routing from author to blog page was never figured out and the more I tried the worse it got. 
pls help me figure out what I was doing wrong.
